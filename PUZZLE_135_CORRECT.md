# ‚úÖ PUZZLE #135 - CORRECT INFORMATION

## GREAT NEWS: Public Key IS Available!

```
Puzzle #135: UNSOLVED but PUBLIC KEY KNOWN!
Address:     13zb1hQRKQRgAs5reRWP3L7snjHUCEDwKE
Public Key:  02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16
Key Range:   0x4000000000000000000000000000000000 to 0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Bit Range:   135 (2^134 to 2^135-1)
Reward:      0.135 BTC (~$5,000)
```

## ‚úÖ RCKangaroo CAN Be Used!

Since the public key is known, **RCKangaroo with your optimized T4 CAN solve this!**

**But the time is still impractical: ~3,000 years on single T4.**

## Command to Solve Puzzle #135

```bash
cd /Users/mac/Desktop/puzzle71/RCKangaroo

# Build for T4
./build_t4.sh

# Solve puzzle #135
./rckangaroo -dp 20 \
  -range 135 \
  -start 4000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  -pubkey 02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16
```

**Warning: This will run for ~3,000 years! You probably won't solve it.**

## Time Requirements

### Single Tesla T4 (1.8 GKeys/s):
**Expected: ~2,988 years**

### Probability of Getting Lucky:

| Luck Level | Time to Solve | Probability |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Average | 2,988 years | 50% |
| Lucky (25% of time) | 747 years | 25% |
| Very Lucky (10%) | 299 years | 10% |
| Extremely Lucky (1%) | 30 years | 1% |
| Jackpot Luck (0.1%) | 3 years | 0.1% |
| Lottery Win (0.01%) | 109 days | 0.01% |

**Yes, you COULD get lucky and solve it quickly - but odds are astronomically low.**

## Multiple T4s

| Configuration | Time | Hardware Cost | Power Cost (@ $0.10/kWh) | Total Cost | ROI |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------------------------|------------|-----|
| 1 T4 | 2,988 years | $3,000 | $18.4M | $18.4M | -99.99% |
| 10 T4s | 299 years | $30k | $1.84M | $1.87M | -99.7% |
| 100 T4s | 30 years | $300k | $184k | $484k | -90% |
| 1,000 T4s | 3 years | $3M | $18.4k | $3.02M | -99.8% |
| 10,000 T4s | **109 days** | $30M | $183k | **$30.2M** | **-99.98%** |
| 100,000 T4s | **11 days** | $300M | $18.3k | **$300M** | **-99.998%** |

**Reward: 0.135 BTC ‚âà $5,000**

## Can You Get Lucky?

**YES, technically!** The Kangaroo method is probabilistic. You could:

1. **Solve it in the first hour** (0.00004% chance)
2. **Solve it in the first week** (0.0003% chance)
3. **Solve it in the first month** (0.001% chance)
4. **Solve it in the first year** (0.03% chance)
5. **Or take 10,000 years**

It's like buying lottery tickets at 1.8 billion tickets per second.

## The Math on "Getting Lucky"

### If you run for 1 year:
- Keys tried: 1.8 GK/s √ó 31,536,000 sec = 5.67 √ó 10^16 keys
- Keyspace: 2^134 = 2.18 √ó 10^40 keys
- Searched: 0.00000026% of keyspace
- **Chance of solving: ~0.03%**

### If you run for 10 years:
- Searched: 0.0000026% of keyspace
- **Chance of solving: ~0.3%**

### If you run for 100 years:
- Searched: 0.000026% of keyspace
- **Chance of solving: ~3%**

**Realistically: You won't solve it unless you get jackpot-level luck.**

## Comparison: Puzzle #135 vs #71

| Feature | Puzzle #71 | Puzzle #135 |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Public Key | ‚ùå Unknown | ‚úÖ Known |
| Can use RCKangaroo? | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Can use Brute Force? | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Kangaroo Time (T4) | ~25 hours (if key existed) | ~3,000 years |
| Brute Force Time (T4) | ~4,700 years | ~10^23 years |
| Difficulty Ratio | 1√ó | 119,000√ó harder |
| Realistic? | Maybe with brute force | Extremely unlikely |

**Puzzle #135 is 119,000√ó harder than #71!**

## Should You Try It?

### Arguments FOR:
‚úÖ Public key is known - RCKangaroo can work
‚úÖ You might get extremely lucky
‚úÖ Someone has to solve it eventually
‚úÖ Learning experience
‚úÖ You have optimized T4 setup ready

### Arguments AGAINST:
‚ùå Expected 3,000 years on single T4
‚ùå 0.03% chance of solving in a year
‚ùå Electricity costs more than reward after ~1 year
‚ùå Other people with more GPUs have better odds
‚ùå Could focus on smaller puzzles instead

## More Realistic Targets

If you want to use your optimized RCKangaroo, consider these instead:

### Solved Puzzles (For Testing):
```bash
# Puzzle #66 (already solved - for testing)
./rckangaroo -dp 15 -range 66 \
  -start 20000000000000000 \
  -pubkey 029f44b4b84ff8c8faa54c0baca1dd8aeced03a20854e396e0b789c6821e73c6d4
# Time: ~30 minutes
```

### Custom Challenge (Create Your Own):
```python
# Make a 50-bit challenge
from coincurve import PrivateKey
import secrets

key = secrets.randbelow(2**50) + 2**49
pk = PrivateKey(key.to_bytes(32, 'big'))
print(f"Pubkey: {pk.public_key.format(compressed=True).hex()}")
# Solve in ~10 minutes on T4!
```

## If You Really Want to Try #135

### Optimized Settings:
```bash
./rckangaroo -dp 20 \
  -range 135 \
  -start 4000000000000000000000000000000000 \
  -pubkey 02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16
```

### Monitor Progress:
```bash
# In another terminal
nvidia-smi dmon -s pucvmet -d 1
```

### What to Expect:
- Speed: 1.8-2.0 GKeys/s ‚úÖ
- GPU Utilization: 95-100% ‚úÖ
- Temperature: Keep under 80¬∞C ‚úÖ
- Progress: 0.0000000001% per hour üòÖ
- Time to solve: Probably never üò¢

## The Honest Truth

### Can you solve Puzzle #135?
**Technically yes, practically no.**

### Is it worth trying?
**Only if you:**
- Don't pay for electricity
- Want to learn and experiment
- Understand it's a extreme long shot
- Are okay with likely never solving it
- Just want to contribute to the search

### What are your actual chances?
**Winning the lottery twice is more likely than solving this in a year.**

## Better Strategy

### Pool Your Resources:
Look for puzzle solving pools where multiple people contribute computing power and share rewards.

### Focus on Smaller Puzzles:
Puzzles in the 80-100 bit range might be more realistic with multiple GPUs over months/years.

### Create Custom Challenges:
Use your optimized setup to solve custom 40-60 bit challenges in minutes/hours for practice.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does puzzle #135 have a public key? | ‚úÖ YES |

## Final Recommendation

### DO:
‚úÖ Test RCKangaroo on smaller puzzles first
‚úÖ Understand it works and achieves 1.8 GKeys/s
‚úÖ Maybe run #135 if you're feeling lucky
‚úÖ Keep realistic expectations

### DON'T:
‚ùå Expect to solve it
‚ùå Invest serious money
‚ùå Count on the reward
‚ùå Quit your day job

### REALITY:
You have:
- ‚úÖ The right tool (RCKangaroo)
- ‚úÖ Optimized hardware (T4)
- ‚úÖ Valid target (puzzle #135 with public key)
- ‚ùå Not enough time (need ~3,000 years)

**Go ahead and try if you want - someone has to solve it eventually, and it could be you! Just keep your expectations realistic. The lottery odds are better, but hey, your GPU is already there! üé∞**
